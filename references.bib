	abstract = {Music is a time-based art form often characterised by patternings; manipulations of sequences over time. Composers and performers may think in terms of patterns, although the structure of patterned sequences are often not made explicit in musical notation. This chapter explores how musical sequences can be created and transformed in real-time performance through patterning functions. Topics related to the use of algorithms for pattern-making are discussed, and two systems are introduced - ixi lang and {TidalCycles}, as high level and expressive mini-languages for musical pattern.},

	abstract = {There is a plethora of computational systems designed for algorithmic discovery of musical patterns, ranging from geometrical methods to machine learning based approaches. These algorithms often disagree on what constitutes a pattern, mainly due to the lack of a broadly accepted definition of musical patterns. On the other side of the spectrum, human-annotated musical patterns also often do not reach a consensus, partly due to the subjectivity of each individual expert, but also due to the elusive definition of a musical pattern in general.},

@article{Toussaint2005Euclidean,
	title = {The Euclidean Algorithm Generates Traditional Musical Rhythms},
	abstract = {The Euclidean algorithm (which comes down to us from Euclid’s Elements) computes the greatest common divisor of two given integers. It is shown here that the structure of the Euclidean algorithm may be used to generate, very efﬁciently, a large family of rhythms used as timelines (ostinatos), in sub-Saharan African music in particular, and world music in general. These rhythms, here dubbed Euclidean rhythms, have the property that their onset patterns are distributed as evenly as possible. Euclidean rhythms also ﬁnd application in nuclear physics accelerators and in computer science, and are closely related to several families of words and sequences of interest in the study of the combinatorics of words, such as Euclidean strings, to which the Euclidean rhythms are compared.},
